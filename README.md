# bored-in-class-v1

Welcome to a world without boredom, a world where no student is bored in class or work and always has something to do.
Bored in class is exactly that, where all people can play games and other fun stuff to bypass the school and work restrictions that hold you back from fun. This is the first version of hopefully many more. Below is the steps to deploy your own link for Bored In Class V1

Step 1: get a github accountI(I will not explain further because if you are looking at this you probably already have a github account)
Step 2: sign up for a vercel account at vercel.com, then allow vercel to link tpo your github account
Step 3: fork this repository using the fork button
Step 4: in vercel go to new and click project
Step 5:  find your forked repository and then name and deploy it

Now you should have you own fully functioning link for Bored-In-Class
